# A program that takes the radius of a circle as input and outputs the area and circumference of the circle.

# Obtaining the radius of the circle
r = float(input("Enter the radius of the circle: "))
# Calculating the circumference of the circle
circumference = 2 * 3.14 * r
print("The circumference of the circle is: ", circumference)
# Calculating the area of the circle
area = 3.14 * r * r
print("The area of the circle is: ", area)
