# Program to print counting numbers upto n, using do-while loop

n = int(input("Enter the value of n: "))
count = 1
if n > 0:
    print("Counting numbers upto", n, "are:")
    while True:
        print(count)
        count += 1
        if count > n:
            break
else:
    print("Please! enter a positive number.")
# Although Python doesn't supports the do-while loop,
# But we can achieve the same functionality using while loop and break statement.
