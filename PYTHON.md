# DATA TYPES IN PYTHON
    1. Numeric
        a) integer
        b) float
        c) complex
    2. Sequence
        a) string
        b) list
        c) tuple
    3. Dictionary
    4. Set

    In python data types are categorised as:
    
    Mutable Data types:
        1. List
        2. Dictiionary
        3. Byte array

    Immutable Data Types:
        1. int
        2. float
        3. complex
        4. string
        5. tuple
        6. set
    
    Mutable object can change its state or contents and immutable objects cannot.

# NUMBER

# STRING
    String is a collection of one or more characters put ib a single quote, double-quote or triple quote, ''' or """

# LIST
    List is an ordered sequence of items.
    It is one of the most used datatype in Python and is very felexible.
    And is denoted by []

# TUPLE
    Tuple is an ordered sequence of items same as a list.
    It is defined within parentheses () where items are seperated by commas.

# DICTIONARY
    Dictionary is an unordered collection of key-value pairs.
    In Python, dictionaries are defined withinn braces {} with each item being a pair in the formm key:value

# SET
    A Set is an unordered collection of items.
    Every set element is unique (no duplicates) and must be immutable (cannot be changed)
    And is denoted by: {}

# User Input and Type casting
    Functions:
    input()
    int()
    float()
    eval()
